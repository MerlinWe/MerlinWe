I am interested in developing data-based solutions for ecological and environmental problems at the intersection of theoretical ecology, computational statistics, and machine learning. 

Currently doing my PhD jointly affiliated with the Environmental Physics and the Ecosystem and Landscape Evolution Group at ETH Zurich, where I work on integrating data of various monitoring techniques (observational, molecular, remote sensing) to develop spatiotemporal biodiversity models to imporve global inferences and forecasting of biodiversity-environment interactions in the context of global change.
