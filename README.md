I am interested in developing data-based solutions for ecological and environmental problems at the intersection of theoretical ecology, applied statistics, and modern data science. 

Currently doing my PhD jointly affiliated with the Environmental Physics and the Ecosystem and Landscape Evolution Group at ETH Zurich, where I work on integrating data of various monitoring techniques (observational, eDNA, remote sensing) to develop spatiotemporal biodiversity models that bridge theoretical ecology with advanced computational methods to imporve global inferences and forecasting.
