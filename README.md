I am interested in finding data-based solutions for ecological, environmental, and sustainability problems at the interface between fundamental ecology and applied statistics
Currently working on my Ecology and Data Science MSc dissertation @UCL, leveraging machine learning techniques to understand patterns of functional traits over forest successional time. 

Also working on projects revolving biodiversity monitoring, advancing citizen science methods for conservation, and herpetology.

Mostly working in R, including R Markdown and Shiny.
