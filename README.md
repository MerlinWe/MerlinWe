I am interested in developing data-based solutions for ecological and environmental problems at the intersection of fundamental ecology, applied statistics, and contemporary data science.
Also involved in projects revolving biodiversity monitoring, advancing citizen science methods for conservation, and herpetology.

Mostly working in R, including R Markdown and Shiny.
