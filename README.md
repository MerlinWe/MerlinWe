I am interested in developing data-based solutions for ecological and environmental problems at the intersection of fundamental ecology, applied statistics, and contemporary data science. Currently doing my PhD jointly affiliated with the Environmental Physics and the Ecosystem and Landscape Evolution Group at ETH Zurich, using environmental DNA and remote sensing to develop spatiotemporal biodiversity models that bridge theoretical ecology with advanced computational methods.
