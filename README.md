I am interested in developing data-based solutions for ecological and environmental problems at the intersection of fundamental ecology, applied statistics, and contemporary data science.
Currently working on my Ecology and Data Science MSc dissertation @UCL, leveraging machine learning techniques to understand patterns of functional traits over forest successional time. 

Also involved in projects revolving biodiversity monitoring, advancing citizen science methods for conservation, and herpetology.

Mostly working in R, including R Markdown and Shiny.
